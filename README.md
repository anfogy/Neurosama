### Who is Neuro then?
Neuro aka Neuro-sama, she's an AI VTuber created by Vedal, she can chat, sing and play video games. She also have a twin called Evil, tho I won't talk about much about her. It's very interesting to watch Neuro streams because sometimes, she really does talk and act like an actual human!
